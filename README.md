# File_Differences
This combines two files we get from EMMIE and removes some unneeded data. This is set to work with three different folder locations. One to hold the two EMMIE files (EMMIE Docs), one to hold today's data (New_EMMIE_File), and one to hold yesterday's data (Old_EMMIE_File). After it combines the EMMIE files, it removes the files from the Old folder, moves yesterday's files from New folder to Old folder, puts today's combined EMMIE file in the New folder, and then compares today's data to yesterday's data. Finally, it produces a new csv with only rows of data that have been added or changed from yesterday's data.
